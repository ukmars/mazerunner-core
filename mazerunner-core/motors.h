/***
 * The Motors class is provided with two main control signals - the forward
 * and rotary speeds. A third input come from the steering correction mechanism
 * used normally when the robot is tracking a wall or line. That input could also
 * come from a trajectory tracker or a target seeker.
 *
 * UKMARSBOT uses DC motors and, to get best performance with least user effort,
 * a combination of feedforward and feedbackcontrollers is used. While this can
 * seem complex, the user need not be aware of all the details so long as the
 * appropriate system characterisation is done to provide suitable values for the
 * various system constants.
 *
 * Under the hood, there are a pair of position controllers which have their set
 * points continuously updated by the desired speeds. Odometry provides feedback
 * for these controllers. greater reliability and precision would be possible if
 * the odometry had better resolution and if an IMU were available. But, you can
 * get remarkably good results with the limited resources available.
