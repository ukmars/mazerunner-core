 * The encoders provide data for localisation of the robot. That is, the encoder
 * data is used to determine the position and orientation of the robot in its
 * environment. If it had one, the robot might also combine encoder data with
 * information form an IMU (gyroscope and accelerometer) to get a more accurate
 * and stable measure of pose (position + orientation).
 *
 * Encoders are subject to various errors and are not reliable when used alone.
 * In particular, simple robots like UKMARSBOt are likely to have low resolution
 * encoders and considerable backlash in the geartrain.

   * @brief update the robot speeds and positions from the encoders
   *
   * The update method is called during each control cycle from the
   * systick event. It will use the change in encoder value since the
   * last call to update values for the current speed, angular velocity,
   * distance travelled and robot angle.
   *
   * The recorded speeds are going to show quite a lot of noise when
   * the encoder resolution is poor. Positions effectively integrate out
   * a fair bit of the noise.
   *
   * The speeds are not recorded directly, only the changes in encoder
   * readings. This slightly reduces the computational load in the
   * systick event and the low-level controllers are only using the
   * changes in robot position and angle, not the speed directly.
   * If you need to see a value for the current speed or angular
   * velocity in real units, use the robot_speed() and robot_omeag()
   * methods.
   *
   * Because update() is called from an interrupt service routine it
   * will be changing the values in ways that the higher level code may
   * not be able to know about. Always use the methods provided that
   * guard against unpredictable changes.
   *
   * If using an IMU, prefer that for measurement of angular velocity
   * and angle.
