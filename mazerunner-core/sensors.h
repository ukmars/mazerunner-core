/**
 *
 * The Sensors class uses the data gathered by the AnalogueConverter to
 * provide basic sensor functions for UKMARSBOT. The sensors class tells
 * the robot about its environment both external and internal. In the
 * case of a micromouse the wall sensors are the primary means of
 * perception. For a line follower, there will be line and marker sensors.
 *
 * Internally, the sensors monitor battery voltage
 *
 * You must call begin() before using the sensors.
 * You must call update() in every control cycle. From systick() normally.
 *
 * Normally, each of the four sensors (two side and two front) would get
 * values for the corresponding channel by calling the AnalogueConverter's
 * get_raw() method. That will return the difference between the lit and
 * dark readings for the channel. Thus a close wall will give a larger
 * value and a distant wall will give a small value. The get_raw()
 * method will always return a value that is at least 1.
 *
 * The sensor are used in many tasks so look in the code for the various
 * convenience methods provided.
 *
 * TODO: it is not clear to me that all these methods should be in this class
 *
 * The normal response of the sensor is very non-linear and the gain - that is
 * the change in value for a small shange in distance - will vary greatly
 * as the distance changes.
 *
 * A linearisation function is provided in the get_distance() method. This
 * uses an approximation that is based on the inverse square root of the
 * sensor reading. You will need to supply a scaling constant that is
 * typically in the range 500-1500 and will be dependent on the
 * characteristics of the sensors you use. Do your own calibration and
 * define a constant in the robot config file. This method is not tied
 * to any sensor in particular. Just give it the calibration constant and
 * the sensor value. You can, for example, use it to linearise the fron
 * sum.
 *
 * The linearised value is limited to 200mm because the signal to noise of
 * small sensor readings is poor and you are unlikely to be able to reliably
 * measure distance out that far with the standard sensors.
 *
 * The linearity is pretty good for most sensors until you get to within
 * about 20mm. It is, however, almost always monotonic within 5mm or a target
 * so it is always possible to use the value to adjust, for example, forward
 * distance from a wall ahead.
