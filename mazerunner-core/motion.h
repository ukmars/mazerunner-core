/***
 *
 * The motion class handles all the higher level Locomotion tasks. It is responsible
 * for converting instructions from a path planner into actual movement of the
 * robot.
 *
 * Motion control needs to know about the dynamics and kinematics of the robot
 * and may need environmental data as well. In particular, the battery voltage and
 * characteristics of the motors will be important.
 *
 * The output from the motion controller should be suitable control signals for
 * the actuators that make the robot move. In UKMARSBOT, that will simply be
 * voltages for each of the two drive motors. Other robots may have more motors,
 * an independent steering system or other kinds of effectors such as grippers or
 * weapons. Remember that the motors may be stepper motors which will need a
 * slightly modified approach.
 *
 * Here, the motion control makes use of simple trapezoidal profiles to calculate
 * continuously varying speeds for linear and rotary motion components.
 *
 * How these speeds are converted into individual control signals for the drive
 * system is the job of the Motors class. Thus is should be relatively easy to
 * change that class to suit different drive systems.
 *
 * TODO: Motion should have be given the profilers
 * TODO: should it also be given the motors?
