/***
 * The Maze class is the heart of the micromouse data.

 *
 * The two main data blocks in the class store the wall state of every cell
 * and a cost associated with every cell after the maze is flooded.
 *
 * To keep code simple, you will note that each wall is stored twice - once
 * as seen from each side. The methods in the maze take care to ensure that
 * changes to a wall are recorded in both associated cells.
 *
 * Before flooding the maze, take care to set the maze mask as appropriate.
 * See the description above for details of the mask.
 *
 * When the robot searches and updates the map, you should call the method
 * update_wall_state() to record changes. The similar-looking method
 * set_wall_state() is private for a reason. It is unconditional and may
 * result in walls being changed after they were frst seen.
