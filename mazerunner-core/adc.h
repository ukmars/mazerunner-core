/***
 * The AnalogueConverter class samples a fixed number of ADC channels from 0 to
 * MAX_CHANNELS and makes the readings available to the rest of the program.
 *
 * Each channel is sampled once with the sensor emitters off and once with the emitters on.
 *
 * The first set of samples is stored in the array m_adc_dark[].
 *
 * The second set, with the emitter on, is stored in m_adc_lit[].
 *
 * For wall sensors, you should use the get_raw() method to read the (lit-dark) values.
 *
 * The class does not care what is connected to the adc channel. It just gathers readings.
 *
 * The battery monitor and analogue button channels are also converted here to avoid conflict.
 * Your config file should declare the channel number for these as well as the actual sensors.
 *
 * This class is specific to UKMARSBOT with a ATmega328p processor. If you are using any other
 * processor, you will need to re-write this class.
 *
 * To save overhead, the class works by using the conversion complete interrupt to gather
 * results only after a successful conversion. The entire sequence is begun by enabling the
 * appropriate interrupt and then starting an ADC conversion. Each interrupt action takes
 * about 5us and conversions take about 30us. Since each channel gets converted twice, the
 * entire sequence takes about 620us to complete but only uses about 100us of processor time.
 *
 * Even if the emitters are disabled, the conversions are still performed but the lit
 * values and dark values will be very similar.
 *
 * Although the code exists almost entirely in this header file, C++ requires the actual
 * instance of the class and its interrupt service routine to be somewhere in a .cpp file.
 * I have placed the instances in the main project file.
 *
 * TODO: some space and time could be saved by only storing the difference between the
 * lit and dark values but it complicates matters elsewhere if code tries to read the
 * values in the middle of the interrupt sequence. If you have all the channels read
 * in one go in a single interrupt service routine - or in systick - then that will not
 * be a problem.
 *
 * TODO: The inclusion in the class of information about the emitters is unfortunate but this
 * is the simplest scheme I could envisage. If there are two emitters, both are turned on
 * together in this version. It would be better to use different emitters for each sensor type.
 * that is left as an exercise for the reader.
 *
 * The code assumes the use of the advanced wall sensor board where there are two emitters. It
 * will work just as well with the basic wall sensor if you simply use the same pin name for
 * both emitter entries.
 *
 * TODO: The A4 and A5 channels get converted in the sequence. If you are expecting to use
 * these for an I2C device, they will need to be skipped.
 *
 * TODO: If only four sensor channels are used, there are opportunities to optimise this
 * code if you are so inclined.
 *
 * PORTING: A simulator may provide fake values as it sees fit and without the delays
 * or interrupts
 *
